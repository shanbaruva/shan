  <p class="me">Hi, I am Shantanu, but you can call me Shan. Born and raised in Assam, India, I moved to London 10 years ago to finish my degree in Business Management and lived here on and off since then.
    <br>
    <br>
    I started my paid work-life with a website called [vivastreet], where I was responsible for customer service for their English websites. Following which, I had to go back to India as my visa was about to expire. While in India, I worked for a charity in my hometown Guwahati. Then moved back to London to do a Masters, following which I worked for within operations for StubHub and GRAKN.AI and then within talent for Entrepreneur First.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also volunteer a lot. Every Thursday evening I volunteer as a drug and alcohol counsellor with London Friend's Antidote service, who provide free counseling for anyone identifying as LGBT+. I am a volunteer with Pride in London since 2014, primarily managing Pride's operation of registering more than 1,000 volunteers for the Pride day. I also help around Terrence Higgins Trust with sexual health outreach and akt with fundraising.
