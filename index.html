<h3>About</h3>
  <p class="me" id="about">Hi, I am Shantanu, but you can call me Shan. Born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam" target="_blank">Assam</a>, India, I moved to London 10 years ago to finish my degree in Business Management and lived here on and off since.
    <br>
    <br>
    I started my paid work-life with a website called <a href="https://www.vivastreet.co.uk" target="_blank">vivastreet</a>, where I was responsible for customer service for their English websites. Following which, I had to go back to India as my visa was about to expire. While in India, I worked for a charity in my hometown Guwahati. Then moved back to London to do a Masters, following which I worked within operations for <a href="https://www.stubhub.co.uk" target="_blank">StubHub</a> and <a href="https://grakn.ai" target="_blank">GRAKN.AI</a> and then within talent for <a href="https://www.joinef.com" target="_blank">Entrepreneur First</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also volunteer a lot. Every Thursday evening I volunteer as a drug and alcohol counselor with London Friend's <a href="http://londonfriend.org.uk/get-support/drugsandalcohol/" target="_blank">Antidote</a> service, who provide free counseling for anyone identifying as LGBT+. I am a volunteer with <a href="https://prideinlondon.org" target="_blank">Pride in London</a> since 2014, primarily managing Pride's operation of registering more than 1,000 volunteers for the Pride day. I also help around <a href="https://www.tht.org.uk" target="_blank">Terrence Higgins Trust</a> with sexual health outreach and <a href="https://www.akt.org.uk" target="_blank">akt</a> with fundraising.

<h4>Why Code?</h4>
  <p class="why" id="code">I have worked with the technology sector for most of my working life.  While working as someone without a background in programming mostly with programmers, I developed a curiosity towards programming and the ability to build and create things through codes.
    <br>
    <br>
The idea for learning how to code came to my mind around 5 years ago. Then last year, I lost my right to work when I applied for my residency in the UK. When I was not permitted to work by the UK Home Office, I was volunteering a lot and had time to think about the future. I felt this would be the right time to make a change in my career and started to teach myself to code.
    <br>
    <br>
In May this year, I got my residency permit along with my right to work. Going through the programme at Founders and Coders, I will now be able to make a career shift and will be able to gain the experience which I missed out on while I was not permitted to work for more than a year. In the future, I would like to use my coding skills to give back to the community. I believe in tech for good!
