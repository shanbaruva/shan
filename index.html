  <p class="me">Hi, I am Shantanu, but you can call me Shan. Born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam" target="_blank">Assam</a>, India, I moved to London 10 years ago to finish my degree in Business Management and lived here on and off since.
    <br>
    <br>
    I started my paid work-life with a website called <a href="https://www.vivastreet.co.uk" target="_blank">vivastreet</a>, where I was responsible for customer service for their English websites. Following which, I had to go back to India as my visa was about to expire. While in India, I worked for a charity in my hometown Guwahati. Then moved back to London to do a Masters, following which I worked within operations for <a href="https://www.stubhub.co.uk" target="_blank">StubHub</a> and <a href="https://grakn.ai" target="_blank">GRAKN.AI</a> and then within talent for <a href="https://www.joinef.com" target="_blank">Entrepreneur First</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also volunteer a lot. Every Thursday evening I volunteer as a drug and alcohol counselor with London Friend's <a href="http://londonfriend.org.uk/get-support/drugsandalcohol/" target="_blank">Antidote</a> service, who provide free counseling for anyone identifying as LGBT+. I am a volunteer with <a href="https://prideinlondon.org" target="_blank">Pride in London</a> since 2014, primarily managing Pride's operation of registering more than 1,000 volunteers for the Pride day. I also help around <a href="https://www.tht.org.uk" target="_blank">Terrence Higgins Trust</a> with sexual health outreach and <a href="https://www.akt.org.uk" target="_blank">akt</a> with fundraising.
